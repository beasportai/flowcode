## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Services
1. **LicensingService**: Manages license validation, feature gating, and subscription status
2. **PaymentService**: Handles payments, subscriptions, and billing
3. **EnterpriseService**: Provides SSO, RBAC, audit logging, and compliance features
4. **WhiteLabelManager**: Automates branding and customization

### Key Features
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Support for multiple organizations
- **Feature Gating**: License-based feature access control
- **Usage Analytics**: Track and bill based on usage metrics
- **Compliance Ready**: SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA support
- **API-First Design**: RESTful APIs for all integrations

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Setup Development Environment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/flowcode/flowcode.git
cd flowcode

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Apply FlowCode branding
node scripts/white-label.js apply branding/flowcode-brand.json

# Start development build
npm run watch
```

### 2. Create Custom Brand
```bash
# Create new brand configuration
node scripts/white-label.js create "MyBrand"

# Apply custom branding
node scripts/white-label.js apply branding/mybrand-brand.json
```

### 3. Build Production Package
```bash
# Build for current platform
npm run gulp vscode-darwin-arm64  # macOS Apple Silicon

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### White-Labeling System
The white-labeling system allows partners to completely rebrand FlowCode:

```javascript
// Example brand configuration
{
  "brandName": "MyBrand",
  "applicationName": "mybrand",
  "primaryColor": "#FF6B6B",
  "logoPath": "./branding/assets/mybrand-logo.png",
  "websiteUrl": "https://mybrand.dev"
}
```

### Licensing System
Feature access is controlled through the licensing service:

```typescript
// Check if feature is available
const hasFeature = await licensingService.isFeatureAvailable(LicenseFeature.AI_AGENT);

// Get usage stats for billing
const usage = await licensingService.getUsageStats();
```

### Enterprise Features
Enterprise organizations get additional capabilities:

```typescript
// SSO Authentication
await enterpriseService.authenticateSSO(SSOProvider.GOOGLE);

// Role-based permissions
const hasPermission = await enterpriseService.hasPermission(Permission.MANAGE_USERS);

// Audit logging
const logs = await enterpriseService.getAuditLogs();
```
